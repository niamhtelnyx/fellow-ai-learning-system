## Part 1: Problem Setup (3 minutes)

### Opening Statement
> "I'm going to show you why we're missing $500K+ in pipeline annually and how we can fix it with AI that reads conversation context instead of demographic data."

### Current State Demonstration
**Pull up Salesforce dashboard showing:**
- Lead qualification accuracy: ~60%
- AE time per qualified lead: 2.5 hours
- Pipeline rejection rate: 72.5%

**Key Quote:**
> "Our current system marked a company needing 25,000 phone numbers as 'not qualified' because they had 15 employees. That's a $50K+ annual contract we almost lost to demographic scoring."

## Part 2: Live Scoring Demo (5 minutes)

### Case Study 1: The Missed Opportunity
**Display Transcript**: Warranty Company Call

```
AE: "What's your main use case?"
Prospect: "We need about 25,000 phone numbers for PII masking in our warranty coordination system. We needed this six weeks ago honestly."
AE: "Interesting, what are you using currently?"  
Prospect: "Right now we're with Twilio but it's expensive. If you can give us 30-40% savings, that's a game changer."
AE: "I'd like to include our technology lead Natalie in the next conversation..."
```

**Live Scoring Demonstration:**

| Scoring Model | Score | Decision | Reasoning |
|---------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Clearbit Demographic** | 32/100 | ❌ Not Qualified | Small company (15 employees), unknown industry |
| **Business Context AI** | 92/100 | ✅ Qualified | High volume (25K numbers), competitive displacement, urgency |

**Business Context Features Detected:**
- 🔢 **Scale Indicators**: "25,000 phone numbers" (high volume)
- 💰 **Competitive Opportunity**: "30-40% savings" vs Twilio  
- ⚡ **Urgency**: "needed it six weeks ago"
- 👥 **Enterprise Signals**: "include technology lead"

**Outcome**: AE progressed to technical evaluation, $50K+ pipeline

### Case Study 2: The Perfect Match (AI + Healthcare)
**Display Transcript**: Healthcare Voice AI Company

```
AE: "Tell me about your platform"
Prospect: "We're building voice AI agents for patient communication in healthcare. Think appointment reminders, medication adherence, post-surgery follow-ups."
AE: "What's your current communication setup?"
Prospect: "We're outgrowing our current provider. Need something that scales with enterprise healthcare clients and handles HIPAA compliance."
```

**Live Scoring:**

| Model | Score | Pattern Match | Business Context |
|-------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Clearbit** | ❌ Not in database | New AI company | No demographic data available |
| **Business Context** | 94/100 | **Healthcare + Voice AI** | 100% conversion pattern |

**Pattern Recognition:**
- 🏥 **Healthcare Vertical**: Patient communication, HIPAA compliance
- 🤖 **Voice AI Technology**: Voice agents, AI automation
- 🏢 **Enterprise Scale**: "enterprise healthcare clients"
- 📈 **Growth Trajectory**: "outgrowing current provider"

**Result**: **Tier 1 Gold Pattern** → Fast-track to senior AE, 100% conversion probability

---

### Case Study 3: The False Positive
**Display Transcript**: Small Marketing Agency

```
AE: "What brings you to Telnyx?"
Prospect: "We send maybe 50 SMS messages a month for our local restaurant clients. Just looking for better rates."
AE: "Any voice or calling needs?"
Prospect: "Not really, just the basic business line stuff."
```

**Scoring Comparison:**

| Model | Score | Decision | Why |
|-------|-------|----------|-----|
| **Clearbit** | 71/100 | ✅ Qualified | Good employee count, marketing industry |
| **Business Context** | 31/100 | ❌ Not Qualified | Low volume, no enterprise signals |

**Business Context Analysis:**
- 📊 **Volume**: "50 SMS/month" (below threshold)
- 🏢 **Scale**: "local restaurant clients" (small business)  
- 💼 **Use Case**: Basic messaging (not enterprise)
- 📈 **Growth**: No scaling indicators

**Outcome**: AE would disqualify in 5 minutes, wasted time avoided

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Responses

**Q: "How do we know the model won't degrade over time?"**
A: "We have continuous learning built in. Every AE qualification outcome feeds back to improve the model. Plus we're tracking model performance daily with automated alerts."

**Q: "What if AEs don't trust the new scoring?"**  
A: "That's why we're doing A/B testing. AEs will see the business context insights alongside scores - things like 'needs 25,000 numbers' or 'replacing Twilio' that clearly indicate qualification."

**Q: "How accurate is the 80.6% number?"**
A: "It's based on 36 test samples with 5-fold cross-validation showing 84% ± 3.6%. We're conservative in our estimates and the A/B test will validate real-world performance."

**Q: "What happens to international prospects?"**
A: "That's our biggest advantage. Business context works regardless of geography. We can qualify a German AI startup or Japanese voice platform because we're reading what they actually need, not their demographic profile."

**Q: "Can competitors copy this?"**
A: "They'd need our conversation data to train similar models. Plus we're continuously improving with new AE feedback. The data advantage creates a competitive moat."

**Q: "What's the risk if we're wrong?"**
A: "A/B testing mitigates risk. Worst case, we fall back to current process. But the data strongly indicates 15-20% improvement minimum, which pays for implementation in month 1."
