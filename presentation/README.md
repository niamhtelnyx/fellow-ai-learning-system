}
```

### Qualification Patterns Data
- **Source**: `/analysis/qualification-patterns.json`
- **10x Conversion Patterns**: 5 industry combinations with 100% rates
- **Business Context Signals**: 8 key predictors ranked by importance
- **Clearbit Replacement Signals**: Conversation-based qualification factors

### ROI Calculations
```python
# AE Time Savings
current_efficiency = 0.60  # 40% wasted time
improved_efficiency = 0.80  # 20% wasted time
time_savings = (improved_efficiency - current_efficiency) * ae_capacity
annual_value = time_savings * hourly_rate * weeks_per_year

# Pipeline Quality Improvement
current_conversion = 0.066  # 6.6% lead to close
improved_conversion = 0.169  # 16.9% lead to close
pipeline_lift = (improved_conversion - current_conversion) * lead_volume
revenue_impact = pipeline_lift * average_deal_size

# Cost Reduction
current_cost_per_lead = 420
improved_cost_per_lead = 245
cost_savings = (current_cost_per_lead - improved_cost_per_lead) * qualified_leads
```
